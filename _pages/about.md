I am a postdoc researcher in Unité de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées - ENS Lyon under the supervision of [Hélène Leman](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/helene.leman/), [Hélène Morlon](https://www.phyloeco.bio.ens.psl.eu/) and [Amaury Lambert](https://smile.cnrs.fr/people/amaury/), currently working on multi-scale approaches in population genetics.


Research interest
------
The core of my reseach activity is the construction and study of deterministic/stochastic models of complex phenomena from Biology and life sciences. More precisely, I my work focuses on mathematical tools for applications in population genetics, (Meta)population dynamics, epidemiology, neuroscience and cell metabolism.
